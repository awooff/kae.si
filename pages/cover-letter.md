## Dear Hiring Manager

As someone with a passion for AI in security, after reading through your companies' mission statement and project goals, I immediately knew that this is the firm that I want to be a part of.

As a means of helping me with my own research into the industry, I recently gave a talk on Firetalks Online, which you can see here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpFU1OvQA_8>, where I discussed the future of the industry & a heavy desire for a growth in AI and big data.
After giving this talk, I now hold the strong opinion that AI will be the dominant means in which threats are handled not only within the industry, but the wider corporate world, and I am excited to be a part of that.

I also have experience in building & connecting APIs, as well as microservices to frontend applications, which was the majority of my work with position at my first job at Loopspeed.
In this position I have proven myself to be a quick and adaptive learner, working closely with my teammates, which I take great pride in.
Being in that position taught me that I excel in a position where I can engage and ask questions to further my own understanding and technical knowledge, as well as providing useful contributions to the project.

In the one year I have been doing professional full-stack web design, I have come a long way, being well versed in many modern technologies used in the bleeding edge of development,
making me a highly desirable candidate for the position.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
