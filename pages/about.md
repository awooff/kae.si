Kae is the so-called "producer" known as *h. x. r. â€ * (xhaart). Making noisy soundscapes since early 2022. They make experimental ambient / breakcore / hardcore electronic music heavily influenced by the likes of *Machine Girl*, *Kayo Dot*, *Tipper* and *Koan Sound*.

They are forming an underground art collective known as __*Elith*__, which aims to spread art, symbols of hope & music to the gentrified city of London, to alleviate the misery of being alive - for themselves, and for others.
In doing so, others who resonate with the ideals - personified into religious deities; __Juno__, __Apollo__, __Gaia__, __Venus__, each representing __Strength__, __Love__, __Earth__ & __The Mother__ respectively.
