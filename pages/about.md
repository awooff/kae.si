## Kaeforest is a wiki & content engine for Elith.

[[Elith]]; derived from Eleutherios[^1]; the greek work anagulous to [Dionysus](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus>), is the moniker given to the collection of philosophical beliefs & overall aims to its artistic movement.

The main desire behind Elith is to express of artistic liberty amidst the dehumanising & abject city of London; to provide symbols & media to beget hope and joy, to dissolve one's misery of being alive.

For long, London has provided limited amounts of dedicated spaces for artists to thrive within their own communities, almost none of this is ever shown to the people, creating a distinct dichotomy between expressions of people against expressions of law & overarching power.

__Our aim is to change this.__

By providing a __wiki__ for [[art]](/art), [[music]](/audio), [[synthesis]](/audio/posts/synthesis) & visual media, Kaeforest aims to enable *hackers*, *activists*, *artists* & *musicians* alike to learn, discover & create artwork within the framework of these ideals, to spread the symbols of hope & peace that the public consciousness lacks.

You can read about our [[philosophy]](/elith) here.

And if you feel like you agree with it or want to be a part, a variety of icons/symbology have been created for you to spread.
