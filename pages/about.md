## Music

The so-called "producer" known as *h. x. r. â€ * (xhaart). Making noisy soundscapes since early 2022. We do some *dark ambient gloomy noisecore jungle liquid avant-garde -* WHO CARES JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN.

If you want to know the process behind the music creation, feel free to read [this writeup](/static/content/Submission.md) we did for uni. More to come on our eventual YT channel.

## Tech stuff

CEH certified as of 2022. We'd like to consider ourselves a qualified sysadmin considering our astounding ability to never update or reboot our system and shipping features by at least the next quarter.

Fluent in `Lua/Moonscript` + any other dialect you probably throw at me.
*Almost* fluent in `Javascript` and `Crystal`, with a good understanding of `Common Lisp`, `Object Pascal`, `Python` (obligatory) and `Bash`.
Comfortable working in `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB` & `Nix`.
