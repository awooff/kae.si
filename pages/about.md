![About Icon](/static/img/about_icon.png)

Kae is the so-called "producer" known as *h. x. r. â€ * (xhaart). Making noisy soundscapes since early 2022. They make experimental ambient / breakcore / hardcore electronic music heavily influenced by *Jungle* and *Breakcore*.

They are forming an underground art collective known as [[__*Elith*__]], which aims to spread art, symbols of hope & music to the gentrified city of London, to alleviate the misery of being alive - for themselves, and for others.
In doing so, others who resonate with the ideals - personified into religious deities; __Juno__, __Apollo__, __Gaia__, __Venus__, each representing __Strength__, __Love__, __Earth__ & __The Mother__ respectively.

To fund their insanity, they took up the accursed profession known as modern web development, specializing in [[Next.JS]], [[MERN]] stack & [[JAMStack]]. And thus their life was never the same. Everything became a hyper-criticality. The world collapsed into a series of *ENONET* and *"x is not a function"* errors - you get the idea. They can make you a site that works. *Just about.*

<br/>

Their company, *Kaesika.systems* builds & open-sources specifications for consumer grade electronics & hardware, currently doing R&D into EMPs, looking for a way to maximize power *efficiency*, *portability* & *power* into a single package - and they want you to be able to build the same! All **without** generating a blast.
