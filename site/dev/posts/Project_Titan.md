## Story

Set in the distant future, a war has broken out between the __Colonial Forces of Saturn__, and the revolutionary forces of the __Jupiter Revival Sect__ separatists.

In a last ditch attempt to sway the outcome of the war, the *CFS* takes it upon themselves to reopen the experimental Dyson Sphere on Helene, tearing a wormhole into the furthest reaches of deep space, in search of the largest source of light matter energy they could find, in a vain attempt to fuel their final weapon that could eliminate the *JRS* and win the war.

However, in doing so, the *CFS* unleashed a primordial force

After the destruction of earth during the final *Battle of Ganymede*, Hirana are left as the final unit of your squadron of the __Coalition of Federated Systems__ (CFS), leaving her stranded thousands of miles away from where the battlefield was.

With her fighter on its final legs, & oxygen supply almost fully depleted, Hirana is forced to let a part of the void spirit subsume her, just to keep her alive long enough to find her lover, and unit commander, who holds the keys to the *Vault of Souls* in the city of [[__R'akkateon__]](./Rakkaeton) on Earth.

And as you make your way back through to the remains of earth, pieces of bodies and buildings are left scattered throughout space which only become more tightly grouped together and the space you traverse through becomes a beautiful abstract art piece as your mind tries to make sense of the horror you're in
With the void spirit slowly eating away at your soul
Your ship starts to grow with the void infestation until it becomes an unrecognisable abomination
Growing stronger as it defeats the newfound guardians of saturn
And as it grows stronger your mind slips further as you're in constant war with the very thing keeping you alive until your sanity starts to slip completely, your ship broken and then finally
