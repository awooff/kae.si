This vessel is now no less than 20 years of age, yet we currently stand in crossroads.
Despite a relatively short timespan, we're left with an inate feeling of isolation despite current social, political and economic standing.
We have it all. Money, a wife, a high paying job & a future, & yet we feel trapped within circumstance. As if nothing we have has been gained other than by circumstance, fate, chance, or whatever have you.

What is left in the midst of total satisfaction? A connection? Free will? Faith? We should be the happiest 20 year old in the world to be in such a position of power & yet still feel like we have nothing. A co-founder. A designer. An artist. Yet it all amounts to what feels like nothing.
Perhaps in time will we feel different, but in our current moment we are nothing. We're about to be part of the fabled 1% with opportunities to become literally anything in the world. How do we even process such a high standing? Has life passed us by already? What are others my age doing? Rotting away, doing a meaningless degree to merge into the workforce of society, whereas we're here about to change the world.

We have no other words to describe such a feeling. And it's all that's on our mind. Apologies for such a rant on what is meant to be such an informative wiki. But this is our feeling. And almost no one can relate.
