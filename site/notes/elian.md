The Elian script is a writing system that draws heavy inspiration from drawings & pictures.
It is comprised of short forms derived from a box grid, where each letter is a section from said grid, and the lines' lengths denoting the letter within the box grid.

It's a form of script that can be utilized in poetry, writing daily notes, and other art-forms, similarly found in old Bedouin impressionist / ink / watercolor art.
