>In a forgotten dejected from our own, the rekindling of the [[Nomad]] is felt through the universe and it takes on this humanoid form, fashioning itself a cloak and staff, with void in place of a face, with nothing but its bloodied insignia as its only detail.
>Its echoes travel felt by the ancient [[hermetic]] tablet bearing the sigil of the cross within the diamond, screaming out for its children after feeling the presence of the [[Nomad]].
>In its desperation it cries its bloodied tears throughout until it reaches the void, reaching its [[Forgotten_City]]; an ancient tomb littered with the vestiges of broken [[vessels]], the livestock long dead; buildings & houses fashioned twisting & contorting as bones of animals, yet convex and almost hollow - and in its centerpiece, the palace; a grandiose monolith fashioned from the tail bone of a whale - it screams in agnoy as the winds of the desert dance through its almost, celestial body.
>Its only population are people fashioned out of clay and horrifically decomposing livestock now reanimated through the tears of the mother, infused with the essence of the [[Void]], turning the populace into disgusting golems, miserable imitations of the memories they once held, begging for their own annihilation.
>An expansive, hollow city floating atop a planet's stormy surface, hollow and screaming, remanents of a civilsation that once was; symbiotic brutalist mess with every fleshy tendril seeping into every facet of its works-

The world of Mazamareth is birthed from the [[Nomad]] that holds the story of Project Titan.
Mazamareth is a universe that holds the story of Project Titan, a story heavily grounded within Hindu mythology about the hubris of humanity & its desire to constantly rewrite its own wrongs in building the foundation for idyllic state of being and pursuit of idyllic relations with self & other civilizations & peoples.

It is a world that tells the tale of humanity's [[hubris]] in having the level of cognizance to recognize the failures of other races & [[Civilizations]].

The Nomad essentially serves as the Polaris of Mazamareth, the divine spark of [[Civilizations]] that lays the foundation for new life. The rekindling is felt throughout the universe and it takes on this humanoid form, fashioning itself a cloak and staff, with void in place of a face, with nothing but its bloodied insignia as its only detail, its echoes travel felt by the ancient [[hermetic]] tablet bearing the sigil of the cross within the diamond, screaming out for its children after feeling the presence of the [[Nomad]]. In its desperation it cries its bloodied tears throughout until it reaches the void, reaching its forgotten city.

In essence, what Mazamareth asks is; "What is the ultimate [[hubris]] of humanity even when we learn from the mistakes of so many others?"

And so lies the gateway to the lessons of kingdoms of divinity and entropy alike, civilizations that hold tales of their failures, teachings and discoveries. How this influenced their architecture, language, shared perception of what they deemed as reality, whether they lived within the construct of time; saw themselves in equal regard & power to the [[Nomad]], or became a byproduct of forces larger than themselves-
Mazamareth is a critique on humanity's perception of its self & what its drive ultimately becomes; its own hubris as byproduct furthers the constant iteration the [[Nomad]] truly sees.
