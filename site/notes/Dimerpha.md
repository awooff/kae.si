The Dimerpha are a sect spawned from the [[Void]]. They were the purveyors of archaic knowledge of the first instances of FTL travel, volatile gateyways within space-time; including methodologies on how to stabalise them, research into endemic memetics to converge realities through [[hyperstition]]; the convergence of realities, and a wealth of literature and art detailing their millenia long history.

Despite the purpose of their discoveries & writings never becoming truly clear; their interaction with other [[Civilizations]] often resulting in the societal conscious being transformed; the peoples desperately noting & researching into completely unrelated subjects their words & meanings, until eventually succumbing to madness from their discoveries, their minds unable to comprehend the complexity & dark truths of Polaris.

Finally, their essence & writings will be harvested by the Dimerpha, their use expired, and their lessons learned.
