As of late I've been doing a lot better; eating healthier, exercising.
Learning.

Exploring.

A lot of my time now has been spent irl as opposed to being a habitually online creature, scouring the net for info and new knowledge to add to my repertoire.
I learned that over this period, I had accrued enough *theory* to do whatever I desired, but the accumulation of theoretical praxis does not make one a good practical *do-er*, which is what my last few months have been dedicated to.
The perfection of my craft.

In this vein, I have also done well to gain more practical experience in Graphic Design, which I'm now quite proud of.

It started off as small edits in Gimp;

Before extending to my own art pieces, made with Figma & Photoshop:

...the latter which I couldn't be more proud of! It turned out just as I had hoped, with every minutia of detail crafted, the perfect texture overlays, subtle gradients and that *really* sick filter- I still fangirl inside thinking about just *how* I managed this.

But, it gave me pause; *I have the power in me to do **literally ++anything++** I want*.
This is the first point in my life where I realize I'm no longer shackled by insecurity, or lack of opportunity, I have friends in both high & low places now.

I'm more-so extremely grateful to myself for creating this site, and still maintaining it to this day, as my knowledge base, my steadfast. A reminder of the servitude I had put into myself over the years. It paid off. Thank you, me.
