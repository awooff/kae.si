Nataziel is the outer perimeter around the ancient city of Dinash.
It is said to be the birthplace of its deity, the descendent of a [[Dimerpha]].

It its prime, it was a birthplace of humanity and understanding, remaining untapped by the corruption of earlier civilizations before it; their old teachings swiftly banned in order

Within its chasms now lie nothing more than an ancient vestige of the [[Void]], corrupting the light essence once brought by the [[Nomad]] after the last breaking of the [[CFS]] during the final [[Holy Conquest]].
