Nataziel is the outer perimeter around the ancient city of Dinash.
It is said to be the birthplace of its deity, the descendent of a [[Dimerpha]].

It its prime, it was a birthplace of humanity and understanding, remaining untapped by the corruption of earlier civilizations before it; many of whose teachings were swiftly banned in the advent of its final ruling government, Hierarchy.
Hierarchy were a ruthless meritocratic political party with heavily allegiance sworn to the Mantis Kingdom, known as [[Kthoria]], conspiring in trade deals

Within its chasms now lie nothing more than an ancient vestige of the [[Void]], corrupting the light essence once brought by the [[Nomad]] after the last breaking of the [[CFS]] during the final [[Holy Conquest]].
