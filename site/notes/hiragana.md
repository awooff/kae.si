Hiragana is a complex, symbol-based syllable writing form used for the Japanese language derived from *kana*. Each *mora* (similar to a syllable based on phonetics) is represented by a singular character *or diagraph*.

There are 5 vowels, being:

| English | Hiragana |
| :---    |     ---: |
|    a    |    あ    |
|    i    |    い    |
|    u    |    う    |
|    e    |    え    |
|    o    |    お    |

And 42 constnant-vowel unions:

- へ Being pronounced é when used as a particle
- を Being used as a particle & in *some* names. It is often pronounced *o* instead.
- ん Used as a singular constonant, used for *n* and *mu*.

While other systems usually use a character known as *chōonpu*, aka. the long vowel mark, it's rarely used in Hiragana, unless when written in the Okinawan diaelect, and in the word らーめん, *rāmen*. But this is seen as non-standard, mainly since most Tokyo residents look down on Okinawans.
