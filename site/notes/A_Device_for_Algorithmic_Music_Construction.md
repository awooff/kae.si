Revolves around talk of [[AI]] for musical [[Synthesis]].

Algorithmic Music Construction provides a logical framework for the theoretical generation of human melodies & overall structure of music.

Their method included four stages:

1. Specification of the theoretical basis
2. Translation of the theory into a set of principles
3. Implementation of the principles as a generative computer [[algorithm]]
4. Test of the output.

Various methodology of creating algorithmic composition includes *Markov chains*, *Knowledge-based systems*, *Grammers*, *Evolutionary methods* divided into genetic algorithms, & *Interactive genetic algorithms*.

Because the method presented in the paper generates music, it can be seen as an instance of algorithmic composition. However, since it was __not__ meant as a test on musical theory rather than classical AI methods, to guide the implementation of the music generating device.
