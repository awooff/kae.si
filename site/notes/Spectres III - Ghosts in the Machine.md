# Spectres III - Fant√¥mes dans la Machine

![Spectres](Spectres.svg)

In Spectres III - Ghosts in the Machine, we learn about the fundamentals of
*why* music is the way it is today, understanding the human expectation within music,
and theorizing how an [[AI]] may create music void of human need of understanding through new
[[Synthesis]] techniques void of human understanding.

In essentiality, the soul and the machine exist within a duality where both wish to try & imitate the other.
We ask the question; how can we use AI to make the best approximation of what speaks to the human soul.
