All will soon realise these two are intertwined.

## Don't use this template or code.

We're not saying this to be mean or because our code is ~amazing~ **(protip: it isn't)** -
and because of this, we're warning you to avoid the headache.
Everything in this repo only makes sense to us, in the true spirit of open source.

We do not care there is *no* documentation - we simply wish to change CSS on occasion
& write posts - have the site maintain itself with minimal interaction.
*And this is what it does.*

If you really want to have a site, make your own; go learn [11ty](https://11ty.dev) like we have
& make something better than this.
All staticgens are horrible, don't be lazy.
Put in the effort & you'll be able to create smth 100x nicer that what we have.
